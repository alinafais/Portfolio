                <h2>Objective</h2>
                <p>
                    The objective of NHA Mobile App is to design and develop a user-centered mobile application for the Nevada Homeless Alliance (NHA) 
                    that enhances accessibility and usability for individuals experiencing homelessness or at risk of eviction. The app seeks to address 
                    critical challenges such as limited internet access, varying levels of tech literacy, and the lack of a unified platform for essential 
                    resources. By providing personalized resource recommendations for shelters, healthcare, food assistance, and other vital services,
                    the application aims to empower users to connect with timely and reliable support. The app focuses on creating
                    an intuitive and inclusive design that ensures a seamless experience, fostering independence and improving the quality of life for underserved populations.

            <h2>Nevada's Homelessness and Accessibility Challenges</h2>
            <p>
                Nevada is grappling with a worsening crisis where homelessness and accessibility 
                challenges converge. Nearly 47.3% of the homeless population has disabilities, 
                emphasizing the urgent need for accessible services. Additionally, 55% of homeless 
                individuals in the state are unsheltered, leaving them without access to vital resources. 
                This group faces heightened health risks due to barriers in receiving care, while chronic homelessness, 
                which has risen by 30%, disproportionately impacts individuals with disabilities. These statistics 
                underscore the pressing need for inclusive solutions to address the needs of Nevada’s most vulnerable populations.

                <p>
                    The charts illustrate the proportion of individuals and families experiencing chronic homelessness in the United States,
                    highlighting the disparity between sheltered and unsheltered populations. Although women represent a smaller portion of
                    the overall homeless population, homelessness among women has been steadily increasing. Since 2022,
                    homelessness among women has risen by 12.1%, and by 11.4% since 2015, with the growth being particularly
                    notable among individual women. Despite fewer women experiencing homelessness compared to men, this trend is deeply concerning.
                    A significant factor is that women are more vulnerable to harassment and assault, with living outdoors further heightening
                    this risk. Additionally, the unsheltered population has nearly doubled between 2022 and 2023. On a national scale,
                    the number of homeless families has also been on the rise since 2020.

                Following the initial sketching phase, I created wireframes using Figma to further refine the design of the NHA Mobile App. These wireframes serve as a blueprint, outlining the structure and layout of the app's key screens, including navigation, resource directories, and user interaction elements. The wireframes focus on usability, ensuring that the app is intuitive and accessible to the target audience. While these wireframes represent my initial vision, they will be iterated upon collaboratively with the team to ensure the final design meets all user needs and project goals.
